This is a project that gets takes user input into the image 
search bar and makes an API call to unsplash photos for 10 
images under the listed term. These images are then displayed
in a grid view.

I learned:
How to use event handlers
Finding what "this" is in different locations
To use arrow syntax when you have a callback
Using axios to make an API call
Props go from parent to children
Using callbacks to get info from children to parents
Using the map function on a list
Using the ref system to access DOM elements
