Created an application that fetches the users location and what month it
is and returns a page saying it is warm or cold outside based on that month and location.

In section 6 I learned learned:
How to construct a class based component
How to get a user's physical location using a windows built in geolocation
About a class components constructor method
How to initialize state in a constructor
How to set state
Intro to app lifecycle
How to handle errors

In section 7 I learned learned:
About Lifecycle methods - componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate and componentWillUnmount
State initialization outside of constructor (how babel makes constructor for you)
Passing state as props
Setting default props
